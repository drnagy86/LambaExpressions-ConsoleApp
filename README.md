##Abstract Classes, Interfaces, Lambda Expressions
When first learning about object-oriented programming, it seemed useful to be able to create a class that could be extended. It also seems very useful as a way to keep code DRY.

It was interesting to learn about the code contract that interfaces create. Understanding that it is an unimplementable set of method definitions was a little confusing at first but seeing how they are applied filled in some gaps in my understanding of polymorphism. It is also interesting to see how dependency inversion is applied to achieve loose coupling to an interface. I can see the advantages of letting the programmer decide how the implementation should work. This will change the way I write code.

I was aware that there was something called Lambda expressions but not sure how it worked exactly. Learning about functional interfaces really puts the pieces together as far as understanding how it works. It still is tricky because much is abstracted away but now I understand more about how Lambda expressions work under the hood.
